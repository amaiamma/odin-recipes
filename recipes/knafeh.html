  <img src="../img/knafeh.jpg" alt="A slice of Knafeh soaked in sugar syrup and topped with crushed pistachios." width="500">
  <p>Knafeh is a traditional Middle Eastern dessert with many variations throughout the region. It's made with a type of pastry dough known as "Kataifi", usually filled with cheese, and soaked in attar (sugar syrup). This specific Knafeh recipe is "Knafeh Nabulsi", which uses a mix of white unsalted cheese and mozzarella as a substitute for Nabulsi cheese—a white brined cheese native to the Palestinian city of Nablus.</p>
  <p>The following recipe was found on the wonderful <a href="https://palestineinadish.com/recipes/palestinian-knafeh-recipe/" rel="noreferrer">palestineinadish website</a> by Wafa Shami. Fully detailed step-by-step instructions, images, and tips are available there. Please check it out!</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>½ pound of Kataifi (8 oz) (half of the bag)</li>
    <li>1 pound of cheese (check the <a href="https://palestineinadish.com/recipes/palestinian-knafeh-recipe" rel="noreferrer">palestineinadish recipe</a> page for insight and alternatives!)</li>
    <li>½ cup unsalted butter or ghee</li>
    <li>¼ crushed pistachios</li>
    <li>1 cup sugar syrup</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Take out the frozen kataifi dough and let it thaw for 2-3 hours before using.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
    <li>Shred the cheese or cut it into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Shred the kataifi dough by placing it in a food processor or with a knife.</li>
    <li>Once shredded, place kataifi dough in a bowl and pour over melted butter and coloring (optional). Using your hands, massage the butter into the dough making sure everything is well integrated.  </li>
    <li>Grease the bottom of the pan with some butter. Use a 9-inch pan. If using the entire kataifi bag use a 18-inch pan.  </li>
    <li>Spread the majority of the dough, leaving about ¼ for the top.</li>
    <li>Add shredded cheese on top, and press well either by the palm of your hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
    <li>Take the remaining kataifi dough spread it over the cheese, and press well again either by hand or with the bottom of a glass.</li>
    <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes or until the edges are deeply golden and crispy and the cheese is melted, you can check the cheese with a fork.</li>
    <li>Take it out of the oven, with care flip it into another (same size or slightly larger) platter, then immediately drizzle the knafeh with about ½-3/4 of the warm sugar syrup, ensuring you cover the full surface. Reserve the remaining syrup to the side for anyone who wants extra.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle crushed pistachios on top.</li>
    <li>Cut into pieces and serve hot.</li>
